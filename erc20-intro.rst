On one side of the trade, there is ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged by a stablecoin [#]_. ERC20 tokens are standardized version of smart contracts with pre-defined API :cite:`Ref08`. Similar to other smart contracts, there are security vulnerabilities on them. Some of these vulnerabilities have been already discovered and handled by the Ethereum community. Here, we introduce a new solution to :ref:`multiple_withdrawal` by analyzing solutions that have been already discovered.
