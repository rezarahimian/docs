ERC20 [#]_ in Ethereum [#]_ ecosystem is a standard that allows any token [#]_ to be created and re-used by other DApps [#]_. Like other smart contracts, there are security vulnerabilities on them. Some of these vulnerabilities have been already discovered and handled by the Ethereum community. Here, we pinpoint potential development mistakes behind a vulnerable ERC20 token.
