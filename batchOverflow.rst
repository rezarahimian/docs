batchOverflow issue
*******************

Description
###########
This vulnerability took place in April 2018 due to integer overflow exploit. Some exchanges (like `OKEx <https://www.okex.com>`_) stopped deposits and withdrawals of ALL ERC20 tokens, especially for `Beauty Ecosystem Coin (BEC) <https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5d105e63711398af9bbff092d4b6769c82f793d>`_ that was targeted by this exploit. Attacker was able to pass values larger than the maximum value that can be held by ``uint256`` data type. As result of integer overflow, only the least significant bits would be retained and effectively causing `wrap around <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow>`_. For example, an ``uint8`` (8-bit unsigned integer) data type can represent maximum value of ``(2^8)-1=255 (0xff)``. Adding ``0x01`` causes overflow and produces ``0x00`` as the result (0xff + 0x01 = 0x100 => 0x00). 

Reproducing the issue
#####################
The same logic is applicable in solidity programming language and we tested for ``uint256`` data type as shown below:

    Figure 1: Integer overflow demonstration in solidity
    
We initially set ``c=0x3`` to check its result before and after addition operation performed by *a_plus_b_default()* function. On the left, we can see initial value of ``c`` before execution of the function and on the right, ``c`` has been set to zero due to wrap around.

Ethereum executes *a_plus_b_default()* function in unchecked context and shows successful status:

Although this is expected behaviour in Ethereum, it causes security problems as explained in `CVE-2018â€“10299 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10299>`_
Recommendation is always use SafeMath library offered by `OpenZeppelin <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol>`_
